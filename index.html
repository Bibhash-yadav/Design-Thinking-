                <li>Accounting: In accounting, documentation involves maintaining records that support financial
                    transactions and reports. This includes invoices, receipts, contracts, bank statements, and other
                    evidence of business activities. Proper documentation ensures transparency, accuracy, and compliance
                    with regulations.</li>
                <li>Healthcare: Documentation refers to patient records, medical histories, treatment plans, and other
                    relevant information that ensures accurate patient care. It also includes reports for billing and
                    legal purposes.</li>
                <li>Business: Documentation can refer to internal policies, operational procedures, contracts, employee
                    records, and any paperwork that helps a business run smoothly and meet legal obligations.</li>
                <li>Technology: It can refer to user guides, system specifications, code comments, and other materials
                    that explain how a system or software works, how to use it, or how it was built.</li>

        <div class="answer">
            <ol type="1">
                <li> <b>Creativity: </b>The ability to think outside the box and generate unique, innovative ideas is essential
                    for a
                    designer. Creativity drives originality in design solutions.</li>
                <li> <b>Attention to Detail:</b> Designers must focus on every small detail, ensuring that their designs are
                    precise,
                    clean, and professional.</li>
                <li><b>Problem-Solving Skills:</b> Designers often address complex issues through their designs. They need
                    strong
                    problem-solving skills to find effective solutions that meet the client's needs.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Technical Skills:</b> A designer must have proficiency in design software (such as Adobe Creative Suite,
                    Figma,
                    or AutoCAD) and a solid understanding of design principles like typography, color theory, and
                    layout.</li>
                <li><b>Communication:</b> Effective communication with clients, team members, and stakeholders is vital to
                    understand
                    the project's requirements and present design concepts clearly.</li>
                <li><b>Adaptability:</b> The design world is ever-changing, and a good designer should be able to adapt to new
                    trends,
                    tools, technologies, and project needs.</li>
                <li> <b>Time Management:</b> Designers often juggle multiple projects with tight deadlines. Good organizational
                    and time
                    management skills are crucial for meeting those deadlines while maintaining quality.</li>
                <li>
                   <b> Empathy:</b> Understanding the needs and preferences of the target audience helps designers create more
                    user-friendly, appealing, and functional designs.</li>
                <li>
                   <b> Collaboration:</b> Many design projects require teamwork. A good designer should be able to collaborate
                    with
                    other professionals such as developers, marketers, and clients.</li>
                <li> <b>Curiosity and Continuous Learning:</b> The design industry is always evolving. A great designer stays
                    curious and continuously seeks to improve their skills and knowledge by learning about new tools,
                    trends, and technologies.</li>
